    Description
    In this project, FrozenLake-v0 environment from Gym OpenAI is utilized.
	The objective is to determine on the minimum list of actions that guide
	an agent from the starting grid at the top left corner to the goal grid
	(Frisbee) at the bottom right corner. Different  static and dynamic
	functions are proposed and their Performance are compared.

    The "main" function (at the very end) is the first function that is run
    in this program. It starts with running the Frozen Lake environment and
    followed by calling the following four functions.

        (1) Manual_Inspection.

        (2) DeÔ¨Åne_a_Function.

        (3) Extended_List.

        (4) Piecewise_Function.

    IMPORTANT TO RUN THE FUNCTIONS:
    Above four functions have been commented inside the "main" function and
    are ready to be uncommented and run individually.
